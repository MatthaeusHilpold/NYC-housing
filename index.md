## Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

If I had written a paper to accompany my research poster, it would be presented here.

The presentation video can be seen here:

If that doesn't work, you can click on the [link to the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5MmebIA8UI&feature=youtu.be)

Anyway, the idea of adding a QR code to the research poster and keeping it minimalistic was inspired by:

Personally, I've always found research posters too packed - this way one can quickly gather the main insight from the poster and, if interested, further explore the topic at home.

Credits for the rat image on the poster goes to Jake Dunham of noun.
